For example, you can modify the personality of the assistant or provide specific instructions about how it should behave throughout the conversation. However note that the system message is optional and the model’s behavior without a system message is likely to be similar to using a generic message such as \"You are a helpful assistant.\"\n",
        "- `{\"role\" : \"user\"}` : The user messages provide requests or comments for the assistant to respond to.\n",
        "- `{\"role\" : \"assistant\"}` : Assistant messages store previous assistant responses, but can also be written by you to give examples of desired behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "The main idea is this:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. You start with a system message that outlines how the LLM should respond, what kind of behaviours you can expect from it, and more\n",
